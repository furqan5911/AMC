1. **Scores for Self-Mastery**

   The enabler "Self-Mastery" is assessed through five key indicators: Emotional Management, Limiting Beliefs Management, Self-Awareness, Mindfulness, and Biased-Free Behavior. Each indicator is evaluated based on several sub-indicators, with scores weighted accordingly.

   - **Emotional Management:** The AI score for Emotional Management is 7.5, derived from sub-indicators like Emotional Awareness and Coping Strategies, each contributing 20% to the overall score. The user's high self-assessed score (8.0) suggests strong emotional regulation, but slight discrepancies indicate room for growth, particularly in resilience and self-reflection.

   - **Limiting Beliefs Management:** This indicator's AI score is 5.0, reflecting challenges in belief identification and proactive prevention. Although the user rated themselves at 8.0, the AI suggests focusing on reframing and thought monitoring to bridge the gap.

   - **Self-Awareness:** With an AI score of 4.0, this indicator highlights significant challenges. Despite the user's high self-rating (9.0), the weightage of sub-indicators like Strengths and Weaknesses and Self-Esteem Alignment suggests these areas require attention.

The AI scores reflect potential unconscious biases and areas where user perceptions may not align with observed behaviors.

   Addressing these gaps requires focusing on sub-indicators with significant discrepancies. Improving resilience, self-reflection, and cultural competence can enhance overall performance.
